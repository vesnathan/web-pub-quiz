This was due to the wartime conditions that made it difficult for the Swedish Academy to properly evaluate candidates and maintain the international scope necessary for the award.

The crisis began when Jean-Claude Arnault, husband of Academy member Katarina Frostenson, was accused of sexual assault and financial misconduct.
