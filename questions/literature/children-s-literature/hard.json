    "detailedExplanation": "Madeleine L'Engle's 'A Wrinkle in Time' faced significant rejection from publishers who found it too different and difficult to categorize, being neither purely science fiction nor children's literature in the traditional sense. The novel, which blends science fiction with coming-of-age themes, was eventually published in 1962 and went on to win the prestigious Newbery Medal in 1963. The book's complex themes of good versus evil, tessering through space and time, and strong female protagonist Meg Murry have made it a enduring classic of children's literature.",

The Alice stories began as tales told to entertain the daughters of his colleague, particularly Alice Liddell. Dodgson was known for his logical puzzles, wordplay, and nonsense literature, which perfectly suited his mathematical mind's approach to creating the fantastical world of Wonderland.",
