These singers are distinguished by their exceptional vocal agility, capable of executing rapid scales, elaborate ornamentations, trills, and sustained notes well above the standard high C (C6). Famous coloratura soprano roles include the Queen of the Night in Mozart's 'The Magic Flute' and the title role in Donizetti's 'Lucia di Lammermoor'.

This differs from vibrato, which is a natural oscillation around a single pitch that adds warmth and richness to the tone. While vibrato is generally considered desirable in opera singing, tremolo is often viewed as a vocal fault when excessive, though it can be used deliberately for dramatic effect. The technique involves rapid alternation between chest voice and head voice, or between two close pitches, and was sometimes employed by early opera singers for expressive purposes.",
