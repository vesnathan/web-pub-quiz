Monet's focus on capturing light and atmospheric effects, particularly in his series paintings of haystacks, water lilies, and Rouen Cathedral, established many of the key principles of Impressionism.",

This technique involved artists leaving their studios to paint directly outdoors, allowing them to observe and capture the changing effects of natural light and weather conditions in real time. The practice was made more feasible by the invention of portable paint tubes in 1841 and lightweight easels. Artists like Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Camille Pissarro embraced plein air painting as it allowed them to achieve the spontaneous, fresh quality and accurate color relationships that became hallmarks of the Impressionist style. This approach contrasted sharply with the traditional academic method of creating detailed studies outdoors and completing finished works in the studio.",

By the 1880s, younger artists were adopting Impressionist techniques, and the style was influencing academic painters.
