    "detailedExplanation": "The invention of collapsible paint tubes in 1841 by American portrait painter John Goffe Rand was crucial to the development of Impressionism. Before this innovation, artists had to mix their own pigments and store them in pig bladders, making outdoor painting extremely difficult. The portable tubes allowed Impressionist painters to work en plein air (outdoors) with fresh, vibrant colors, capturing the changing effects of natural light that became central to their movement.",

    "detailedExplanation": "The term 'Impressionist' was coined by art critic Louis Leroy in a satirical review of the 1874 exhibition. He mockingly used the title of Claude Monet's painting 'Impression, Sunrise' (Impression, soleil levant) to criticize what he saw as unfinished, sketch-like works. Leroy wrote that even wallpaper in its embryonic state was more finished than Monet's seascape. The artists eventually embraced this initially pejorative term, and it became the official name of their revolutionary movement.",
