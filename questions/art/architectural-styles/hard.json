    "detailedExplanation": "Byzantine architecture, developed in the Eastern Roman Empire from the 4th century onwards, made significant innovations in dome construction. The most notable contribution was the pendentive system, which solved the complex engineering problem of placing a circular dome over a square base. These curved triangular sections distribute the dome's weight to the four corners of the square base below. The Hagia Sophia in Constantinople is the most famous example of this technique.",

This style was characterized by its emphasis on vertical lines and the use of rectilinear tracery that created large, rectangular panels in windows and wall surfaces. The tracery patterns resembled grids rather than the flowing curves of earlier Decorated Gothic style. This created an effect of strong vertical emphasis throughout the building, from floor to ceiling.
