His most notorious sale was 'Christ with the Adulteress' to Nazi leader Hermann Göring for 1.65 million guilders. After the war, van Meegeren was initially charged with treason for selling Dutch cultural treasures to the Nazis, but he confessed to forgery to avoid the death penalty, proving his innocence by painting another fake Vermeer in court.",
