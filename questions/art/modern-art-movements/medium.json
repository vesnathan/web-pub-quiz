Instead of mixing colors on a palette to create the desired hue, artists would apply small, separate brushstrokes of pure color directly to the canvas. When viewed from an appropriate distance, these colors would optically blend in the viewer's eye, creating more vibrant and luminous effects than traditional mixing methods. This technique was used by artists like Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Camille Pissarro, and later influenced Post-Impressionists and Neo-Impressionists like Georges Seurat.",
