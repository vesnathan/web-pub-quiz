This revolutionary movement broke away from traditional perspective by depicting subjects from multiple viewpoints simultaneously, using geometric shapes and fragmented forms. The movement is often divided into two phases: Analytical Cubism (1909-1912) and Synthetic Cubism (1912-1919). Cubism fundamentally changed how artists approached representation and influenced numerous subsequent art movements.",
