    "detailedExplanation": "Dada emerged during World War I as an anti-war, anti-bourgeois, and anti-art movement. Founded at the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich by Hugo Ball and Emmy Hennings, the movement's name has several origin stories, but the most widely accepted is that it was chosen randomly from a French-German dictionary. The word 'dada' means 'hobby horse' in French, but the arbitrariness of the selection perfectly embodied the movement's rejection of logic and embrace of nonsense and chance.",

    "detailedExplanation": "Pointillism, also known as Divisionism, was developed by Georges Seurat in the 1880s based on scientific theories of color and perception. The technique involves applying small, distinct dots of color in patterns to form an image. When viewed from an optimal distance, the dots visually blend to create more vibrant and luminous colors than traditional mixing techniques. Seurat's masterpiece 'A Sunday on La Grande Jatte' (1884-1886) is the most famous example of this meticulous technique.",

Malevich believed that art should express pure artistic feeling rather than depict objects from the visible world. His 'Black Square' (1915) represented the zero point of painting - the end of objects and the beginning of pure artistic sensation.

The artist would place paper over various textured surfaces like wood grain, leaves, or fabric, then rub over them with pencil or charcoal.

Art critic Louis Vauxcelles, seeing a Renaissance-style sculpture surrounded by these vivid canvases, remarked 'Donatello au milieu des fauves' (Donatello among the wild beasts), giving the movement its name. The Fauves liberated color from its descriptive function, using pure, unmixed pigments straight from the tube to express emotion rather than represent reality.
