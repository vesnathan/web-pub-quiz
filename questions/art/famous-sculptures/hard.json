    "detailedExplanation": "Auguste Rodin's 'The Gates of Hell' was commissioned in 1880 for a decorative arts museum in Paris. The massive bronze sculpture was inspired by Dante's 'Divine Comedy,' specifically the Inferno section. The famous 'Thinker' sculpture, which has become iconic in its own right, was originally conceived as part of this larger work, representing Dante himself contemplating the circles of Hell below. The project consumed much of Rodin's later career, and the final bronze cast wasn't completed until after his death.",

The Romanian sculptor also created versions in marble and one in black marble, but the bronze versions are the most famous and numerous. The sculpture's sleek, elongated form was so abstract that U.S. customs officials in 1926 initially refused to classify it as art, leading to a famous legal case that helped establish the rights of abstract art.",

Works like 'Walking Man' and 'The Pointing Man' reflected the post-World War II existentialist philosophy, capturing themes of human isolation, anxiety, and the search for meaning in an uncertain world. The extremely thin, rough-textured figures seem to embody the existentialist concept of humans as fundamentally alone in the universe, making Giacometti one of the most important sculptors associated with this philosophical movement.",

This was groundbreaking because traditional sculpture had always been static. Calder's mobiles introduced the element of time and motion, creating sculptures that were never the same from moment to moment.

This technique involves positioning a human figure so that one part of the body is twisted or set against another, typically with the weight resting on one leg while the other is relaxed. This creates a natural S-curve through the body and was first masterfully employed in sculptures like Polykleitos's Doryphoros (Spear-Bearer).
