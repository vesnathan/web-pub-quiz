    "detailedExplanation": "While the Greeks excelled at idealized human forms, the Romans revolutionized portraiture by creating realistic sculptures that captured individual features, wrinkles, and imperfections. This style, known as veristic portraiture, emerged during the Roman Republic and reflected their values of honesty and experience. Roman portrait busts were often displayed in homes to honor ancestors and were remarkably lifelike compared to the idealized Greek sculptures that preceded them.",

This technique was particularly famous for the Fayum mummy portraits from Roman-era Egypt (1st-3rd centuries CE). These remarkably well-preserved portraits were painted on wooden panels and placed over the faces of mummified bodies. The wax medium allowed for rich colors and fine detail, and its durability has enabled many of these portraits to survive to the present day, providing invaluable insight into ancient portraiture techniques.",

    "detailedExplanation": "Black-figure pottery was a dominant Greek ceramic painting technique from the 7th to 5th centuries BCE. Artists would paint figures and decorative elements using a special slip that turned black when fired, creating dramatic silhouettes against the natural red-orange color of the clay. Details within the black figures were created by incising lines before firing, revealing the red clay beneath. This technique was particularly associated with Athenian pottery and reached its peak in the 6th century BCE before being largely replaced by the red-figure technique, which reversed the color scheme.",
