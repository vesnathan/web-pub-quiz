    "detailedExplanation": "Wet-on-wet, also known as 'wet-in-wet' or 'alla prima', is a painting technique where wet paint is applied to a wet surface or into wet paint. This technique is particularly popular in watercolor painting, where wet paint is applied to wet paper or into areas of wet paint, allowing colors to blend and flow naturally. The technique creates soft, organic edges and smooth color transitions, making it ideal for painting skies, water, and other natural elements that require gentle gradations.",

    "detailedExplanation": "Tempera is a permanent, fast-drying painting medium consisting of colored pigments mixed with a water-soluble binder medium, traditionally egg yolk. This medium was widely used in European panel painting from the 12th to 15th centuries, before being largely superseded by oil painting. The egg yolk acts as an emulsifier, binding the pigment particles together and allowing the paint to adhere to surfaces. Tempera dries quickly and creates a matte finish with excellent permanency and color retention.",

The word comes from Italian meaning 'dough' or 'mixture'. This technique adds texture and dimension to paintings, creating a sculptural quality. Famous artists like Vincent van Gogh and Rembrandt were known for their use of impasto. The thick application of paint can create dramatic light effects as the raised areas catch light differently than the recessed areas, adding visual interest and tactile quality to the artwork.",

    "detailedExplanation": "Lithography is a planographic printmaking technique invented in the late 18th century by Alois Senefelder. The process is based on the chemical principle that oil and water repel each other. Artists draw on a smooth limestone surface or specially prepared metal plate using greasy materials like lithographic crayons or pencils. The surface is then treated with a chemical solution that fixes the drawing and makes the drawn areas receptive to oil-based inks while the non-drawn areas repel ink. This allows for multiple identical prints to be made from a single drawing.",

Most acrylic paints are water-based, but become water-resistant when dry. Developed in the 1940s and 1950s, acrylic paint became commercially available in the 1960s and quickly gained popularity among artists due to its versatility, quick drying time, and ease of cleanup. Unlike oil paints which can take days or weeks to dry, acrylics typically dry within hours, allowing artists to work more quickly and layer colors without long waiting periods.",

The closer together the lines are drawn, the darker the tone appears to the viewer. The direction of the hatching lines can also follow the contours of the subject to help define form and volume. This technique has been used by artists for centuries and is particularly common in pen and ink drawings, engravings, and sketches. When combined with cross-hatching (lines going in different directions), it can create very rich and complex tonal variations.",
