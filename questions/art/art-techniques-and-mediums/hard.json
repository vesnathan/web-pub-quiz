    "detailedExplanation": "Fresco is an ancient painting technique that involves applying water-based pigments onto freshly laid lime plaster while it's still wet. As the plaster dries, it forms calcium carbonate crystals that trap the pigments, making them an integral part of the wall surface. This technique was famously used by Renaissance masters like Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel and requires working quickly before the plaster sets, making it one of the most challenging painting mediums.",

Unlike Western woodblock printing, mokuhanga uses water-based pigments and a baren (a flat disc-like tool) to transfer ink from carved wooden blocks to paper. The technique typically requires separate blocks for each color, and master printers could use dozens of blocks for a single image. This method produced the famous ukiyo-e prints by artists like Hokusai and Hiroshige.",

This minimal binding allows for exceptional color purity and intensity. Pastels come in soft, hard, and oil varieties, with soft pastels being the most popular for their ability to blend smoothly and create subtle gradations.

The word derives from the Greek 'enkaustikos,' meaning 'to burn in.' This technique was used extensively in ancient Egypt for mummy portraits from the 1st to 3rd centuries CE, particularly in the Fayum region. The wax creates an extremely durable medium that resists moisture and aging, which is why many ancient encaustic works have survived in remarkable condition.

The artist draws directly onto a limestone surface (or specially treated metal plate) using greasy materials like lithographic crayons or tusche. The stone is then treated with a chemical solution that makes the non-image areas attract water and repel ink, while the drawn areas attract ink and repel water. This allows for direct, expressive mark-making and was revolutionary because it enabled artists to print exactly what they drew, leading to its adoption by artists like Toulouse-Lautrec for poster making.",
