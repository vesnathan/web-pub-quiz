    "detailedExplanation": "Alla prima, also known as 'wet-on-wet' painting, is a technique where an artist completes a painting while the paint is still wet, typically in one session. This allows for spontaneous blending of colors directly on the canvas and creates soft transitions between hues. The technique was popularized by Impressionist painters like Monet and Renoir, who valued its immediacy and ability to capture fleeting light effects.",

    "detailedExplanation": "Lithography, invented in 1796 by Alois Senefelder, is a planographic printing process based on the chemical repulsion between oil and water. The artist draws on a flat limestone or metal plate with a greasy medium, then treats the plate with chemicals so that ink adheres only to the drawn areas while water applied to the plate is repelled by the greasy image areas but accepted by the blank areas. This allows for multiple identical prints to be made.",

The egg yolk acts as an emulsion that binds powdered pigments together, creating a fast-drying, durable paint with vibrant colors. Artists like Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci used egg tempera for many of their masterpieces. The medium dries quickly and allows for precise detail work, but requires skill to blend colors smoothly.",

This rapid cooling and reduction atmosphere creates unique, unpredictable effects including metallic lusters, crackling, and dramatic color variations.
