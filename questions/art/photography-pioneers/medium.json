His famous image 'View from the Window at Le Gras' was created using a camera obscura and a pewter plate coated with bitumen of Judea. The exposure took approximately 8 hours, and while the image is grainy and indistinct by modern standards, it represents the birth of photography as we know it.",

This process produced highly detailed images on silver-plated copper sheets and required exposure times of just a few minutes in bright sunlight. The French government purchased the patent and released it 'free to the world,' leading to a global photography boom and the establishment of portrait studios worldwide.",
