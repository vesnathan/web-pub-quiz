    "detailedExplanation": "Louis Daguerre's 1838 daguerreotype 'Boulevard du Temple' is famous for containing the first photographed human figure. The long exposure time (several minutes) meant that moving people and traffic didn't register on the plate, but one man standing still while getting his shoes shined was captured. Daguerre developed the daguerreotype process, which created highly detailed images on silver-plated copper sheets, making photography more practical and popular in the 1840s.",
