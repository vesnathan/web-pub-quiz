    "detailedExplanation": "Vincent van Gogh produced an extraordinary number of self-portraits during his brief but prolific career, creating over 60 self-portraits in total. These works served as both artistic practice and psychological exploration, as he often couldn't afford to pay models. His most famous self-portraits include those painted in 1889 after the ear-cutting incident in Arles, showing himself with a bandaged ear. These self-portraits are considered among the most psychologically penetrating in art history.",

    "detailedExplanation": "Johannes Vermeer's 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' (c. 1665) achieves its distinctive luminous quality through the artist's masterful use of glazing techniques. Glazing involves applying thin, transparent layers of paint over dried underlayers, allowing light to pass through and reflect back from lower layers, creating depth and brilliance. Vermeer was particularly skilled at this technique, often using expensive pigments like ultramarine blue and vermillion. The pearl earring itself demonstrates this technique perfectly, appearing to glow with inner light. This method, combined with his careful attention to the effects of natural light, gives the painting its timeless, almost photographic quality.",

He used a publicity photograph from Monroe's 1953 film 'Niagara' as the source image, silk-screening it repeatedly with varying colors and treatments.
