    "detailedExplanation": "Michelangelo Buonarroti, primarily known as a sculptor, was commissioned by Pope Julius II to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City. The project took four years to complete (1508-1512) and features nine scenes from the Book of Genesis, including the iconic 'Creation of Adam' where God's finger nearly touches Adam's finger. Despite his reluctance to take on the project, considering himself more of a sculptor than a painter, Michelangelo created one of the most celebrated masterpieces in Western art.",

    "detailedExplanation": "Linear perspective was a revolutionary artistic technique developed during the Italian Renaissance, most notably by architect Filippo Brunelleschi in the early 15th century. This mathematical system allows artists to create the illusion of three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface by using converging lines that meet at vanishing points on the horizon. Renaissance painters like Masaccio, Paolo Uccello, and later Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael, mastered this technique, which became fundamental to Western art and helped distinguish Renaissance painting from the flatter, more symbolic medieval art that preceded it.",

Tempera consists of pigments mixed with a water-soluble binder medium, typically egg yolk. This medium allowed for precise detail and bright, lasting colors, making it ideal for the detailed religious and mythological subjects popular during the Renaissance. Artists like Botticelli used tempera for masterpieces like 'The Birth of Venus,' while later Renaissance painters began adopting oil paints, which had been developed in Northern Europe.",
