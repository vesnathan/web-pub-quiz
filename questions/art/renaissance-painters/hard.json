This technique eliminated harsh outlines and created a smoky, atmospheric quality that gave his subjects an ethereal appearance. The Mona Lisa remains the most famous example of sfumato, where the subject's enigmatic expression is enhanced by the subtle blending of light and shadow around her face.",
