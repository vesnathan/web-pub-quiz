    "detailedExplanation": "Gill Sans was developed by British sculptor and typeface designer Eric Gill between 1928-1930, initially commissioned by Stanley Morison for the London and North Eastern Railway and London Underground. The typeface became one of the most recognizable and widely used sans-serif fonts in British design, embodying the principles of clarity and legibility that defined modern transportation graphics. Its humanist characteristics, derived from Gill's background in stone carving and calligraphy, distinguished it from the more geometric sans-serifs being developed in continental Europe at the same time.",

    "detailedExplanation": "The International Typographic Style, pioneered by designers like Josef Müller-Brockmann and Armin Hofmann in Switzerland during the 1950s, revolutionized graphic design through its systematic approach to layout. The movement's fundamental principle was the use of modular grids based on typographic measurements, where all design elements were positioned according to mathematical relationships derived from the chosen typeface's characteristics. This approach eliminated subjective decision-making in favor of objective, systematic design solutions that emphasized clarity, readability, and universal communication across language barriers.",

This philosophy, influenced by architect Louis Sullivan's earlier writings, became central to modernist design thinking. At Bauhaus, graphic design students learned that every design element should serve a communicative purpose, rejecting ornamental decoration in favor of clarity, efficiency, and universal accessibility.
