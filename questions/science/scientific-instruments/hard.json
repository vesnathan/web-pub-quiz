As the tip approaches the surface, atomic forces (van der Waals forces, electrostatic forces, etc.) between the tip and sample atoms cause the cantilever to deflect. A laser beam reflects off the cantilever onto a photodetector, which measures these minute deflections with sub-angstrom precision. By mapping these force interactions across the surface, the AFM constructs detailed topographical images with resolution down to the atomic level. Unlike electron microscopes, AFM can operate in air, liquid, or vacuum conditions and can image non-conductive samples, making it invaluable for studying biological specimens, polymers, and nanomaterials.",

    "detailedExplanation": "A Geiger counter operates on the principle of gas ionization and avalanche discharge within a sealed tube filled with an inert gas (typically helium, neon, or argon) and containing a central wire electrode. When ionizing radiation enters the tube, it strips electrons from gas atoms, creating ion pairs. The tube operates at a high voltage (typically 400-900 volts) such that these initial ion pairs trigger an avalanche effect, where secondary ionizations rapidly multiply the number of charge carriers. This creates a brief but detectable electrical pulse that is amplified and counted by the associated electronics. Each radiation event produces a distinct pulse, making it possible to count individual radiation events and measure radiation intensity. This simple yet effective design has made Geiger counters the standard portable radiation detection instrument since their invention by Hans Geiger and Walther Müller in 1928.",
