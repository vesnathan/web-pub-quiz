    "detailedExplanation": "Xylem is one of the two main types of vascular tissue in plants, specialized for transporting water and dissolved minerals from the roots to all other parts of the plant. This tissue consists of hollow, tube-like cells that form a continuous pathway from the roots to the leaves. The movement of water through xylem is driven by transpiration - the evaporation of water from leaf surfaces - which creates a negative pressure that pulls water upward through the plant, even in very tall trees.",
