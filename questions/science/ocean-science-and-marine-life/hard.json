    "detailedExplanation": "Biennial plants have a distinctive two-year life cycle that distinguishes them from annuals (one year) and perennials (multiple years). In the first growing season, biennials typically produce only vegetative growth, forming a rosette of leaves and storing energy in roots or stems. They then experience a cold winter period (vernalization), which is often required to trigger flowering. In the second growing season, they bolt, flower, produce seeds, and die. Classic examples include carrots, parsley, foxglove, and many members of the Brassica family. This strategy allows plants to build substantial energy reserves before reproduction and often helps them compete effectively in disturbed habitats.",
