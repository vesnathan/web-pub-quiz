Truman adopted the phrase 'The Buck Stops Here' as his personal motto and kept a sign with these words on his desk in the Oval Office throughout his presidency (1945-1953). The phrase derives from the poker term 'pass the buck,' meaning to pass responsibility to someone else. Truman's version meant the opposite - that ultimate responsibility rested with him as President. He received the sign as a gift and it became symbolic of his leadership style, emphasizing accountability and decisive action during critical moments like the decision to use atomic weapons and the Korean War.",

According to the historian Suetonius, Caesar used this succinct three-word phrase to describe the swiftness of his victory to the Roman Senate. The battle was part of Caesar's campaign in Asia Minor, and the phrase perfectly captured both the brevity of the campaign and Caesar's confidence.

The speech was initially controversial within Reagan's own administration, with the State Department and National Security Council attempting to remove the provocative line. However, Reagan insisted on keeping it, directly challenging Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to demonstrate his commitment to glasnost and perestroika by removing the Berlin Wall. The wall eventually fell in November 1989, and Reagan's speech is now considered one of the most significant moments in Cold War diplomacy.",

Whether or not he literally said these words, they accurately reflect his governing philosophy and the centralization of power that characterized his rule at Versailles.
