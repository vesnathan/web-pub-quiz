In his Prison Notebooks, Gramsci argued that dominant classes maintain power not just through coercion, but through winning the consent of subordinate groups by making their worldview appear natural and inevitable. This theory has been crucial in understanding how ideological control functions in modern societies and has influenced fields from political science to media studies.",
