Under the original Electoral College system, electors cast two votes without distinguishing between president and vice president. The House of Representatives voted 36 times over six days before finally choosing Jefferson as president on February 17, 1801. This election led directly to the 12th Amendment, which required separate votes for president and vice president.",

The term 'khaki' referred to the color of British military uniforms. The strategy worked, as the Conservatives maintained their majority by appealing to patriotic voters who supported the war effort. This was one of the first examples of a government using foreign military action to boost domestic electoral prospects.",
