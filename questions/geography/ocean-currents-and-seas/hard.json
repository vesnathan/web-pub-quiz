The term itself comes from 'thermo' (temperature) and 'haline' (salinity). Cold, salty water is denser and sinks, while warm, less salty water is lighter and rises. This process begins in polar regions where surface water becomes very cold and salty (due to ice formation that leaves salt behind), causing it to sink and flow along the ocean floor toward the equator. Meanwhile, warmer surface currents flow toward the poles to replace the sinking water. This circulation pattern takes approximately 1,000-1,600 years to complete one full cycle and plays a critical role in distributing heat around the planet, significantly influencing global climate patterns.",
