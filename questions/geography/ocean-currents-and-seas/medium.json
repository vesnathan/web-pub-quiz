    "detailedExplanation": "Thermohaline circulation is a global system of ocean currents driven by density differences in seawater, which are controlled by temperature and salinity variations. Cold, salty water is denser than warm, fresh water, causing it to sink in polar regions, particularly in the North Atlantic and around Antarctica. This dense water then flows along the ocean floor toward the equator, while warmer surface waters flow poleward to replace it. This circulation pattern plays a crucial role in distributing heat around the planet and regulating global climate, moving approximately 15-20 million cubic meters of water per second worldwide.",

Its high salinity is due to high evaporation rates, minimal freshwater input, and limited connection with the Indian Ocean through the narrow Bab-el-Mandeb strait. While the Dead Sea has much higher salinity (around 340 parts per thousand), it is technically a hypersaline lake rather than a sea connected to the ocean.

The major wind systems of the world, including the trade winds, westerlies, and polar easterlies, create corresponding patterns of ocean circulation. However, the direction of these currents is also significantly influenced by the Coriolis effect, which deflects moving water to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. Additionally, the presence of continents constrains and redirects these currents, creating the characteristic gyre patterns observed in each ocean basin. While factors like underwater topography and tidal forces play roles in local current patterns, wind remains the primary driving force for large-scale surface circulation.",

This restricted connection limits the ability of the tidal bulge from the Atlantic to propagate effectively into the Mediterranean basin. Additionally, the Mediterranean's relatively small size compared to open oceans means that the gravitational forces from the moon and sun don't have the same space and time to build up significant tidal movements. The sea's complex coastline and numerous islands further dampen tidal effects by creating friction and interference patterns that reduce tidal amplitude throughout the basin.",

    "detailedExplanation": "The Coriolis effect is a phenomenon caused by Earth's rotation that affects all moving objects, including ocean currents. As water moves across the Earth's surface, the rotation of the planet beneath it causes an apparent deflection of the current's path. In the Northern Hemisphere, this deflection is to the right of the direction of motion, while in the Southern Hemisphere, it's to the left. This effect is strongest at the poles and weakest at the equator. The Coriolis effect is crucial in shaping large-scale ocean circulation patterns, contributing to the formation of the clockwise gyres in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise gyres in the Southern Hemisphere. It also influences the behavior of storms, winds, and other atmospheric phenomena.",
