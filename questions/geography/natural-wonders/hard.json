They occur scattered either as isolated or clusters of boulders within a stretch of beach where they have been protected in a scientific reserve. The erosion by wave action of mudstone, comprising local bedrock and landslides, frequently exposes embedded isolated boulders. These boulders are grey-colored septarian concretions, which have been exhumed from the mudstone enclosing them and concentrated on the beach by coastal erosion.",

To prevent the spread of methane gas, geologists decided to burn off the gas, expecting it would extinguish in a few days. However, the crater has been burning continuously for over 50 years. The diameter of the crater is 70 meters (230 feet), and it has a depth of 20 meters (66 feet), creating a spectacular fiery display visible from miles away.",

The sandstone was deposited during the Jurassic period as sand dunes, and over millions of years, the iron oxide or hematite and manganese oxide staining created the characteristic red, pink, orange, and yellow colors.
