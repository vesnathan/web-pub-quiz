    "explanation": "Molten rock underground is called magma; it becomes lava when it reaches the surface.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The terminology for molten rock depends on its location. When molten rock is still beneath the Earth's surface, it is called magma. Once this molten rock erupts from a volcano and flows on the Earth's surface, it is then called lava. This distinction is important in volcanology as magma and lava can have different properties due to temperature changes and gas content differences.",

    "detailedExplanation": "The majority of earthquakes occur due to tectonic plate movement. The Earth's outer shell, called the lithosphere, is divided into several large and small pieces called tectonic plates that slowly move over the underlying mantle. When these plates interact at their boundaries - whether they're moving apart, sliding past each other, or colliding - they can become stuck due to friction. When the stress overcomes the friction, the plates suddenly move, releasing energy in the form of seismic waves that we feel as earthquakes.
