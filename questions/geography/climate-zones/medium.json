It uses temperature and precipitation data to classify climates into five main groups (A, B, C, D, E) with various subdivisions. This system remains the standard for climate classification in geography, meteorology, and ecology textbooks worldwide.",

This pattern is caused by the seasonal shift of high-pressure systems that block rainfall during summer months.
