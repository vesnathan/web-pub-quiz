Areas with high continentality (far from oceans) experience greater temperature extremes between seasons and between day and night, due to land's lower heat capacity compared to water. Maritime climates (low continentality) have more moderate temperatures year-round due to the ocean's moderating influence. This concept is crucial in climate classification systems and helps explain why continental interiors often have more extreme seasonal temperature variations than coastal areas at similar latitudes.",
