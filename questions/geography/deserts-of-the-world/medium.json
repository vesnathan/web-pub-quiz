Prolonged droughts, rising temperatures, and reduced rainfall contribute to the natural expansion, while human activities such as overgrazing by livestock, deforestation, and intensive agriculture degrade the soil and remove vegetation that would otherwise prevent desert encroachment.

Summer temperatures can reach 50°C (122°F), while winter temperatures can drop to -40°C (-40°F). This dramatic range occurs because the desert is located deep within the Asian continent, far from oceans that would moderate temperatures. Ocean waters heat up and cool down much more slowly than land masses, so coastal areas experience less extreme temperature swings than inland continental areas like the Gobi.",
