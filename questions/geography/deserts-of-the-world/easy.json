It is renowned as the driest non-polar desert on Earth, with some weather stations in the region never having recorded rainfall. The desert's extreme aridity is caused by its location between two mountain ranges and cold ocean currents that prevent moisture from reaching the area. Some parts of the desert are so similar to Mars that NASA uses it for testing Mars rovers.",
