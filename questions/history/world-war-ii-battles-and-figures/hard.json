    "detailedExplanation": "Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, nicknamed the 'Desert Fox' for his tactical brilliance in North Africa, was implicated in the July 20, 1944 assassination attempt on Hitler. Though his actual involvement remains debated by historians, Nazi officials gave him the choice between a public trial (which would have meant execution and disgrace for his family) or suicide with full military honors. He chose suicide by cyanide pill on October 14, 1944, and was given a state funeral with his true cause of death hidden from the public.",

On June 19 alone, the Japanese lost over 400 aircraft while the Americans lost only 29. The battle effectively ended Japanese carrier-based aviation as an offensive force, with Japan losing three aircraft carriers and most of its remaining experienced pilots.",
