Despite having the option to propose exile as an alternative punishment, Socrates remained defiant during his trial. He was ultimately sentenced to death and required to drink a cup of poison hemlock, which he did while surrounded by his disciples, as famously recounted in Plato's dialogue 'Phaedo'.",

    "detailedExplanation": "The Sarissa Phalanx was a revolutionary military formation developed by Philip II of Macedon and perfected by his son Alexander the Great. The formation featured soldiers wielding sarissas - spears that were significantly longer than traditional Greek spears, measuring between 13-18 feet. This length advantage allowed Macedonian phalanxes to strike enemies before they could get close enough to use their shorter weapons. The formation required extensive training and coordination, but proved devastatingly effective in Alexander's conquests across the known world.",

This naval supremacy proved crucial during the Persian Wars, particularly at the Battle of Salamis in 480 BCE, where the Greek fleet, dominated by Athenian ships, decisively defeated the much larger Persian navy of Xerxes I.
