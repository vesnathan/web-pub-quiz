    "detailedExplanation": "Edward I of England (1239-1307) earned the nickname 'Longshanks' because of his unusual height for the medieval period, standing over 6 feet tall. In 1290, he issued the Edict of Expulsion, which ordered all Jews to leave England by November 1st of that year. This made England the first European country to expel its entire Jewish population, and Jews were not officially readmitted until Oliver Cromwell's time in the 1650s. Edward I was also known for his military campaigns in Wales and Scotland.",
