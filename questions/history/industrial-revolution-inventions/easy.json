    "detailedExplanation": "James Watt's improvements to the steam engine in 1769 revolutionized industrial production. His key innovation was the separate condenser, which prevented the loss of heat that occurred in earlier engines when steam was condensed in the same cylinder where it was generated. This made the engine about four times more fuel-efficient than previous designs and helped power the Industrial Revolution.",
