His crushing victory over Horatio Gates at the Battle of Camden in August 1780 seemed to validate this approach, with Gates's army completely routed. However, the strategy ultimately failed due to stronger Patriot resistance than expected and the lack of sustainable Loyalist support, culminating in Cornwallis's surrender at Yorktown in 1781.",
