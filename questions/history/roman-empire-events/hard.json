Ancient historians like Suetonius recorded that he threatened to make his favorite horse Incitatus a consul, though this was likely more a display of contempt for the Senate than an actual appointment. Caligula also began serious preparations for the invasion of Britain, assembling troops at the English Channel, though the actual conquest was completed under his successor Claudius in 43 CE.",
