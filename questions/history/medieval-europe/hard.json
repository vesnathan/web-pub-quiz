This charter established strict regulations for medical practice and education, requiring physicians to study for at least three years and pass examinations. The school was particularly renowned for its diverse faculty, including women practitioners, and its synthesis of Greek, Roman, Arabic, and Jewish medical knowledge.",

    "detailedExplanation": "The three-field system was a major agricultural innovation that emerged around 800 CE, replacing the older two-field system. In the two-field system, half the land lay fallow each year while the other half was cultivated. The three-field system divided land into three parts: one for winter crops (like wheat), one for spring crops (like oats or barley), and one left fallow. This rotation increased productivity by about 33% and provided better nutrition through crop diversity, contributing significantly to the population growth of the High Middle Ages.",

Before its introduction, horses were harnessed around the neck with straps that pressed against their windpipe, severely limiting their pulling power. The horse collar distributed the load across the horse's chest and shoulders, allowing them to pull up to five times more weight than before. This meant horses could effectively replace slower oxen for plowing, significantly increasing agricultural productivity and enabling the cultivation of heavier soils, particularly in Northern Europe.",
