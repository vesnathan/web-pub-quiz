    "detailedExplanation": "Nuclear pulse propulsion was a theoretical spacecraft propulsion concept studied by Project Orion from 1958 to 1968. The system would work by detonating small nuclear charges behind a large steel pusher plate attached to the spacecraft with shock absorbers. Each explosion would push against the plate, accelerating the craft. While theoretically capable of achieving very high specific impulses and enabling fast interplanetary travel, the project was cancelled due to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and safety concerns.",
