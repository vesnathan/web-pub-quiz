    "detailedExplanation": "A zester is a kitchen utensil specifically designed to remove the colorful outer peel (zest) of citrus fruits like lemons, limes, and oranges while avoiding the bitter white pith underneath. Traditional zesters have small sharp holes that scrape off thin strips of zest, while modern microplane zesters create finely grated zest. The zest contains essential oils that add intense citrus flavor to dishes.",
