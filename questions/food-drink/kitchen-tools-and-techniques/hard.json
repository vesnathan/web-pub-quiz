    "detailedExplanation": "Katsuramuki is a highly skilled Japanese knife technique that involves peeling vegetables like daikon radish into paper-thin, continuous sheets that can be several feet long. The technique requires a very sharp knife and precise control, as the vegetable is rotated against the blade while maintaining consistent pressure and angle. These thin sheets are often used as garnishes, for wrapping ingredients, or cut into fine julienne strips for salads and other preparations.",

    "detailedExplanation": "High-carbon steel, typically containing 0.6-1.5% carbon, is prized by professional chefs and knife enthusiasts for its superior edge retention and ability to be sharpened to an extremely fine point. The higher carbon content creates a harder blade that stays sharper longer than stainless steel alternatives. However, high-carbon steel requires more maintenance as it's prone to rust and staining, and develops a patina over time.

This creates a more durable edge that can withstand the harder use common in Western cooking techniques, though it sacrifices some of the razor sharpness that Japanese knives achieve with their 10-15 degree angles.
