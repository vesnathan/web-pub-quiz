The Olmecs discovered that the seeds of the cacao tree could be processed into a bitter drink, which they considered sacred. This knowledge was later passed down to subsequent Mesoamerican civilizations, who refined the process and incorporated chocolate into their religious and social practices.",

The real culprit was the high lead content in the pewter plates used by the wealthy - the acidic tomatoes would leach lead from the plates, causing lead poisoning symptoms and death. Poor people, who ate from wooden plates, had no such problems with tomatoes. This association with death among the upper classes led to tomatoes being avoided in Europe for over 200 years, while they were embraced much earlier by lower social classes and in the Americas.",

Mushroom ketchup was particularly popular in 18th-century Britain and America.
