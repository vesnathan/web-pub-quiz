It was so precious that it was used as currency, paid as tribute, and even included in dowries. The spice trade routes that brought pepper from India to Europe were fiercely contested, and pepper's high value was one of the primary drivers behind the Age of Exploration as Europeans sought direct routes to spice-producing regions.",

Unlike capsaicin in chili peppers, which binds to pain receptors in the mouth and throat, allyl isothiocyanate primarily affects the nasal passages and sinuses, creating a sharp, penetrating sensation that quickly dissipates. This compound is also found in horseradish and mustard, explaining their similar pungent qualities.

The key difference lies in their extended maturation period - these peppercorns are left on the vine significantly longer than standard black pepper, allowing them to reach a larger size (at least 4.25mm in diameter) and develop more complex aromatic compounds. This extended growing period allows the essential oil content to increase and the flavor profile to become more nuanced, with deeper, more robust notes.
