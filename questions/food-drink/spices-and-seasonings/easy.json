It takes about 150 flowers to produce just 1 gram of saffron, as only the three red stigmas from each flower are used. This labor-intensive harvesting process, combined with its distinctive flavor and coloring properties, has earned saffron the nickname 'red gold' throughout history.",

    "detailedExplanation": "Black pepper gets its characteristic pungent heat from piperine, an alkaloid compound found in the fruit of the pepper plant. This is different from the capsaicin that makes chili peppers hot. Piperine creates a sharp, biting sensation rather than the burning heat of capsaicin. When pepper is ground, piperine is released, which is why freshly ground pepper is more potent than pre-ground pepper.",

This creates a different type of heat than capsaicin (chili peppers) or piperine (black pepper) - it's more volatile and affects the nasal passages rather than the tongue, which is why wasabi heat dissipates quickly and clears the sinuses.",
