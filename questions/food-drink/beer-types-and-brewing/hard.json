It stipulated that beer could only be made from water, hops, and malt (yeast was added later when its role was understood). This law was designed to ensure beer quality and prevent bakers and brewers from competing for precious grains like wheat and rye, which were needed for bread production.",

This mineral content, known as 'Burton water,' became so associated with excellent IPAs that the process of adjusting water chemistry to match Burton's profile is called 'Burtonization.'
