    "detailedExplanation": "Cocoa beans, harvested from the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao), are the fundamental ingredient that gives chocolate its unique flavor profile. These beans contain compounds like theobromine and various flavor compounds that develop during fermentation, drying, and roasting processes. While sugar, milk, and vanilla are common additives that modify chocolate's taste, the cocoa beans themselves are what make chocolate distinctively 'chocolate-flavored' rather than just sweet.",

    "detailedExplanation": "Profiteroles are made using choux pastry (also known as pâte à choux), a light pastry dough that relies on steam for leavening rather than chemical leaveners like baking powder. When baked, the high water content in choux pastry creates steam that puffs up the dough, forming hollow centers perfect for filling with cream, ice cream, or other sweet fillings. This same pastry is also used to make éclairs, cream puffs, and croquembouche. The technique was developed in France and requires cooking the flour and water mixture on the stove before adding eggs.",

In the 17th century, Italian chefs perfected techniques for creating smooth, creamy frozen desserts using a mixture of ice, salt, and cream or milk. The Medici family in Florence is often associated with early ice cream development, and Italian gelato masters refined the art further. Antonio Latini published one of the first ice cream recipes in 1692. The tradition spread throughout Europe and eventually to America, where it evolved into the ice cream industry we know today.",

    "explanation": "Beaten egg whites provide the air bubbles that make a soufflé rise when heated.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The secret to a soufflé's dramatic rise lies in beaten egg whites, which are carefully folded into a flavored base. When egg whites are whipped, they incorporate air bubbles and form a stable foam. During baking, the heat causes the air in these bubbles to expand, creating the soufflé's characteristic height and light texture. The proteins in the egg whites coagulate during cooking, setting the structure. This is why soufflés must be served immediately after baking - as they cool, the air contracts and the soufflé deflates. Both sweet and savory soufflés rely on this same principle.",

This high cocoa content gives dark chocolate its intense flavor and slightly bitter taste. Milk chocolate usually contains 10-50% cocoa solids, with added milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains no cocoa solids at all, only cocoa butter, sugar, and milk solids. Ruby chocolate, a newer variety, contains some cocoa solids but is processed differently to achieve its pink color and fruity flavor.
