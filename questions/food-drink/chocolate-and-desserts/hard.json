Unlike dark or milk chocolate, white chocolate contains no cocoa solids (the brown part that gives chocolate its color and much of its flavor). This absence of cocoa solids is why many chocolate purists argue that white chocolate isn't 'real chocolate.' Quality white chocolate must contain at least 20% cocoa butter, along with sugar, milk solids, and vanilla, creating its sweet, creamy flavor profile.",
