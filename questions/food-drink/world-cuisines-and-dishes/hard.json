    "detailedExplanation": "The secret to authentic Japanese tempura lies in using ice-cold water (sometimes with ice cubes added) and mixing the batter as little as possible - just enough to barely combine the ingredients. This technique prevents gluten development in the flour, which would make the batter tough and chewy. The batter should remain lumpy with visible flour streaks. This creates the characteristic light, crispy, and delicate coating that tempura is famous for.
