The ocean in Moana has its own personality, emotions, and ability to interact meaningfully with characters, particularly Moana herself. This required Disney's animators to develop entirely new techniques for giving water anthropomorphic qualities while maintaining its fluid, natural properties. The technical challenge was immense, as animators had to make water expressive and character-like without losing its fundamental physical properties. This innovation represented a significant leap forward in both technical animation and storytelling possibilities.",
