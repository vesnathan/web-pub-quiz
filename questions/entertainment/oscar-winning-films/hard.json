The film received the X rating due to its mature themes involving prostitution and homosexuality, though it contained no explicit sexual content by today's standards. The X rating was later changed to R when the film was re-released. This unprecedented win highlighted the Academy's recognition of artistic merit over commercial considerations during the New Hollywood era.",
