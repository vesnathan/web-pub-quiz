The musical was created through a series of recorded interviews with Broadway dancers sharing their personal stories, which were then crafted into the show by Michael Bennett, Marvin Hamlisch, and Edward Kleban. The title was changed to A Chorus Line before its off-Broadway premiere, better reflecting the audition process that forms the show's central conceit.",

    "detailedExplanation": "Agnes de Mille's choreography for Oklahoma! was groundbreaking because it integrated dance directly into the narrative structure of the musical, rather than treating it as decorative interludes between songs and dialogue. The famous 'Dream Ballet' sequence, in particular, advanced the plot by revealing Laurey's subconscious fears and desires about her romantic choices. This approach influenced countless musicals that followed and helped establish the 'book musical' format where all elements serve the story.

This was necessary because Charles Dickens died before completing his final novel, leaving the mystery unsolved. The musical presents itself as a Victorian music hall performance, with the cast acknowledging the audience throughout. This innovative format won Holmes the Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical in 1986, making him the first person to win Tony Awards for book, music, and lyrics for the same show.",
